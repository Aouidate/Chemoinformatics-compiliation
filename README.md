**Chemoinformatic Tools**

* [Rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/) or [here](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Cookbook.html
):is a free and open-source cheminformatics toolkit for Python. It is one of the most popular chemoinformatic tools available, and it is used by researchers and developers around the world. RDKit provides a wide range of features, including molecular structure handling, chemical similarity calculation, and molecular property prediction.
        
* [ChemmineR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ChemmineR/inst/doc/ChemmineR.html) : is a free and open-source cheminformatics software package for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides a graphical user interface for performing a variety of chemoinformatic tasks, such as molecular structure visualization, chemical similarity calculation, and molecular property prediction.

* [DataWarrior](https://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/) : An Open-Source Program for Data Visualization and Analysis with Chemical Intelligence


**Active Learning Tools**

* [modAL](https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) :  an active learning framework for Python3, designed with modularity, flexibility and extensibility in mind. Built on top of scikit-learn, it allows you to rapidly create active learning workflows with nearly complete freedom. What is more, you can easily replace parts with your custom built solutions, allowing you to design novel algorithms with ease.

**Databases**

* [ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/): is a free online database of chemical compounds. It provides information on the structure, properties, and biological activity of millions of compounds. ChemSpider is used by researchers, students, and the general public.

* [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/):  is a free online database of chemical compounds. It provides information on the structure, properties, and biological activity of millions of compounds. PubChem is used by researchers, students, and the general public.
