**Cheminformatic Tools**

* [Rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/) or [here](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Cookbook.html
):is a free and open-source cheminformatics toolkit for Python. It is one of the most popular chemoinformatic tools available, and it is used by researchers and developers around the world. RDKit provides a wide range of features, including molecular structure handling, chemical similarity calculation, and molecular property prediction.
        
* [ChemmineR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ChemmineR/inst/doc/ChemmineR.html) : is a free and open-source cheminformatics software package for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides a graphical user interface for performing a variety of chemoinformatic tasks, such as molecular structure visualization, chemical similarity calculation, and molecular property prediction.

* [DataWarrior](https://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/) : An Open-Source Program for Data Visualization and Analysis with Chemical Intelligence

* [Datamol](https://github.com/datamol-io/datamol) : The Datamol library is a powerful tool for working with molecules in Python. It is designed to be a lightweight layer built on top of RDKit.

* [deepchem](https://deepchem.io/) : DeepChem is a Python library for machine learning and deep learning on molecular and quantum datasets. It is built on top of PyTorch, and other popular ML frameworks. It is designed to make it easy to apply ML to new domains, and to build and benchmark new models. It is also designed to make it easy to use ML in production, by providing easy-to-use model export and deployment APIs

* [Scikit-mol](https://github.com/EBjerrum/scikit-mol) : Scikit-mol is a Python library designed for cheminformatics and molecular machine learning. It builds on scikit-learn and RDKit, providing tools for handling molecular data, feature extraction, and applying machine learning models to chemistry-related problems.

* [pdChemChain](https://github.com/EBjerrum/pdchemchain) : It is a framework for reusable manipulations of pandas dataframes for both interactive and command line usage. The framework was made for chemistry actions via RDKit, but can easily be used for other domains as well, as the auto-configuable and self-documenting features of the framework are quite nice and versatile. It is a nice framework for building reusable processing steps and pipelines for pandas. It's meant for iterative building/experimenting in notebook and interactive sessions, but supports saving the final pipeline for command line usage.

**Handling Small Molecules**

* [Gypsum-DL](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/gypsum-dl/0) : Gypsum-DL is a free, open-source program that converts 1D and 2D small-molecule representations (SMILES strings or flat SDF files) into 3D models. It outputs models with alternate ionization, tautomeric, chiral, cis/trans isomeric, and ring-conformational states.

* [Open Babel](https://openbabel.org/docs/Installation/install.html) or [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openbabel/) : Open Babel is a chemical toolbox designed to speak the many languages of chemical data. Itâ€™s an open, collaborative project allowing anyone to search, convert, analyze, or store data from molecular modeling, chemistry, solid-state materials, biochemistry, or related areas.

**Active Learning Tools**

* [modAL](https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) :  an active learning framework for Python3, designed with modularity, flexibility and extensibility in mind. Built on top of scikit-learn, it allows you to rapidly create active learning workflows with nearly complete freedom. What is more, you can easily replace parts with your custom built solutions, allowing you to design novel algorithms with ease.

**Databases**

* [ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/): is a free online database of chemical compounds. It provides information on the structure, properties, and biological activity of millions of compounds. ChemSpider is used by researchers, students, and the general public.

* [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/):  is a free online database of chemical compounds. It provides information on the structure, properties, and biological activity of millions of compounds. PubChem is used by researchers, students, and the general public.

* [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/): ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.

* [COCONUT](https://coconut.naturalproducts.net/) : Natural Products Online is an open source project for Natural Products (NPs) storage, search and analysis. The present version hosts COCONUT, the COlleCtion of Open Natural ProdUcTs, one of the biggest and best annotated resources for NPs available free of charge and without any restriction.

* [Lotus](https://lotus.naturalproducts.net/) : One of the largest and best-annotated resources for NP occurrences, available free of charge and without any restrictions. LOTUS is a dynamic database that is hosted both on its official website and on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). The Wikidata version enables community curation and the addition of new data if needed.

* [BindingDB](https://bindingdb.org/rwd/bind/index.jsp) : BindingDB contains 2.9M data for 1.3M Compounds and 9.3K Targets. Of those, 1,388K data for 649K Compounds and 4.5K Targets were curated by BindingDB curators.
